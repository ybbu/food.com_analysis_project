# Recipes & Ratings Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, I used two datasets (*recipes* and *interactions*) that contain all recipes and ratings records from 2008 to 2018. The datasets were directly scraped from [Food.com](https://www.food.com/), a website that ranks in the [top 30](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/food-and-drink/cooking-and-recipes/) of the world's most-visited cooking sites. The *recipes* dataset contains 83782 rows and 12 columns, each row corresponding to recipe. The *interactions* dataset contains 731927 rows and 5 columns, each row corresponding to a viewer-submitted review about a recipe.

My analysis is centered around the question: **What are the characteristics of high rating recipes?** Specifically, I analyzed how cooking time, cooking complexity, preparation difficulty and calorie level may affect the average ratings of recipes. These four characteristics are related to these columns: (in *recipes* ,) `'minutes'`, `'nutriton'`, `'n_steps'`, `'n_ingredients'`, and (in *ingredients* ,) `'rating'`. Below are a detailed description of each relative column:

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `'minutes'`| Minutes to prepare recipe |
| `'nutrition'` | Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| `'n_steps'` | Number of steps in a recipe |
| `'n_ingredients'` | Number of ingredients in a recipe |
| `'rating'` | Rating given by a viewer |


Understanding the question could help a potential submitter to better predict future ratings of his/her recipes. Also, high rating corresponds to a higher public preference. When building a recommender system, researchers may reference to this analysis to have a general sense of what recipes types might have a higher popularity. 

## Cleaning and EDA

### Data Cleaning

- Merging: In order to calculate the average ratings per recipe, I left merged the *recipe* dataset and the *interaction* dataset. Since one can only rate between 1-5 on Food.com, value 0 in the `'rating'` column acutually means 'missing', so I replaced it with `np.NaN`.
- Data Type Conversion: Since all the data was scraped from the website, list-like variables like `'nutrition'` and `'tags'` were represented as strings. I converted these variables to lists.
- Adding additonal columns: I splitted the `'nutriton'` column and added a new column `'calories'` to the dataset since it's key variable in my analysis.
- Consistently "incorect" values: I noticed that the `'tags'` column contained values like '' and 'less_thansql:name_topics_of_recipegreater_than' which were equivalent to missing values, similiar to the `'description'` column. I replaced them with `np.NaN`.
- Unreasonable outliers: I noticed some unreasonable data in `'calories'` and `'minutes'`. Specifically, there were recipes that were more than 10000 calories. There were also recipes that took more than 43200 minutes (a month) but didn't explicitly mention the word "month" in its detailed steps (for example, "*after 6 months you can..." would be a valid input*). I deleted these rows from the dataset as they account for less than 0.05% of all recipes.

Below is the `head` of my cleaned Dataframe:
